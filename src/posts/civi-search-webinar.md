-   searching vs reporting
-   searching as a skill
-   search preferences
-   the wildcard % stands for one or more characters

Reports

-   for printing/display
-   can pick columns
-   can group
-   can be run automatically
-   can be Dashlets

Search

-   best for finding things
-   good for filtering
-   good for batch actions

Current search methods are driven by different code! Can this lead to different results when a user searches the same data in two ways?

Search settings in Civi

-   administer > customise > search preferences
-   wildcard. By default added at start and end of search term
-   include email?
-   search primary details (a contact's primary address). Best set to no for us as we're not too huge
-   include nickname?

Ways of searching

-   quick search, top left on menu. Output is customisable in settings. Wait (shows in dropdown) or hit enter (displays all results in a table)
-   basic search. Search > find contacts. 4 fields only
-   advance search. Powerful. Can display results in a Profile. Not good at looking for blank data fields. Can set a "view" of the results which could be different from the criteria! Search operator.

And narrows a search as they have to meet both criteria. Or broadens the search. Within a group this is set to Or.

Civi has an optional trash system. PA uses it
