Trying to get Hannah's own Instagram feed on her own web site

-   Instagram provides embed code for a single post. It comes bundled with multiple Instagram wrappers showing links, comments etc etc. Little of this can be stripped out because the whole thing is provided by a js script. You can remove the text message but you seem to be stuck with the other guff. This is fine for displaying the latest Instagram post, but useless when you want a gallery view of images only.
-   Instagram provides an API with a nightmare labryrinth of time-limited auth tokens. I did actually try that way before and had to renew every 3 months. It failed to validate my first renewal and I lost access. I gave up.
