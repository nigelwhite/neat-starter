You can easily embed one Instagram post with code Instagram provide eg

```html
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned>
        <div style="padding:16px;">
          <a
              href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP1gUKSHFbU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading"
              target="_blank"
          >
        </div>
        <script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
      </blockquote>
```

This provides the whole post, text and links.

With this method you can't embed just the image. You can't embed a gallery of images.

If you want those things you have to do the ridiculously long authentication process demanded by Instagram. You are supposed to re-authorise every few months. I did this, but it did not remain stable over time. I couldn't bear to do it again.
