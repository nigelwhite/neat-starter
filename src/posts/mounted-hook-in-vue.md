Trying to understand how to use Mounted to insert one Instagram post on the Inkpot site.

I don't know
- how to write the code under Mounted so it is ready to be inserted into the dom
- how to target the place in the dom where I want it to appear

Later maybe I can get a yaml file with a bunch of Instagram urls, to use on the Diary page of the site.
