File permissionserrors on local containers
execute in the root shell terminal (any folder - the root folder works fine)
docker exec permaculture-drupal bash -c permissions.sh
wait.... takes a couple of minutes

File permissionserrors on Stage containers
in portainer run permissions.sh (from any folder - the root folder works fine)

Libraries don't show until you enable modules so the libraries were there all along!!

Next: Refresh my local Docker containers from Stage. Tom will prepare/revise documentation for this.
Tom will get Civi working on Memcahe
