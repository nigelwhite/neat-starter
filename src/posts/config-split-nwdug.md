Fabian Bircher on Config Slit 2.

DrupalCon Oct 4-7

Original purpose of config split eg split off the Devel module and make sure it does not get deployed in production.

Drush will show you the difference between config in storage and the state of your active site?

Split config as if it had been deleted. Split modules as if they had been uninstalled.

Splits can be active/not active = State Status. In drush or UI

Not sure about this......
