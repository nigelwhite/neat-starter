Issue

-   I could not add new tags to the options online

Solution

-   added a tags_source collecton
-   can now add items to this online
-   change the Netlify widget from select to relation in admin/config.yml. This reads out a list of titles from the tags_source folder.
-   can now select these for insertion

See [Netlify widget docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/)
