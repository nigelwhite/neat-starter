I asked about this at the Civi Meetup today

Others have the same experience with eg Eventbrite, Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp

Its a CRM issue, not a Civi issue: applies to any CRM.

Civi is a workhorse but does not look pretty while doing it.

Plusses of 3rd party services

\* quick to learn

\* quick on each use

\* they look slick

Minusses of 3rd party services

\* Cost of manual data transfer later (or API integration if you are clever enough)
\* Data in places your data policy has not covered
\* Fragmentation of your data so its less useful - you loose revenue
\* 3rd party services do one thing well. limited functionality compared to Civi

Some people have come from 3rd party services and say they prefer Civi as it can do more.

In an organisation it has to come from the top, "This is what we are using". Hard to get this style of management in the charity sector.

Training and awareness of staff
