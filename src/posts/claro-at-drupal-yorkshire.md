Drupal core Claro maintainer Sascha Eggenbergera
Drupal Design System...?
Not stable yet

Claro

-   will update itself in cycles
-   will be long term
-   will be the default theme

[Gin](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin)

-   admin theme
-   gin is dependant on claro, but is already in advance of claro - has more features.
-   in alpha but very stable
-   has contrib modules as add-ons eg gin_lb for Layout Builder
-   CSS Adjustments to Gin. Don't make a subtheme! Small changes can be made by adding a gin-custom.css if you want to customise stuff.
-   ckeditor style. in theme.info.yml define your stylesheet so ckeditor uses front end styling. I didn't get all the details......
-   use ajax for admin views for fast loading for the views used by editors.
-   use paragraphs icons for easier recognition of Paragraphs. Recommended is Feathericons opensource library

You can combine Paragraphs and Layout Builder "to get the best of both". Grrrr.
CKEditor 5 is coming in the future - will allow blocks.
Which is the future?.....Guttenburg, Paragraphs and Layout Builder, CKEditor 5? Nobody knows.....
